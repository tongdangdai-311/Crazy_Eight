/**
 * NOTE: You will modify this code
 * <p>
 * NOTE This is a sample, fictitious card game
 * <p>
 * This is the main driver for the game of Top This. It supports 3 or more players. Players take
 * turns using a simple character cell console interface.
 * <p>
 * Goal: to collect the most melds
 * <p>
 * Rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>use 1 or more decks of standard playing cards (52 cards per deck, 4 suits, 13 ranks, no
 * jokers) as specified by the players
 * <li>3 or more players are each dealt the same number of cards (as specified by the players), one
 * at a time, in rotation
 * <li>the players specify the number of rounds
 * <li>the first player dealt a card is the first to play in the first round
 * <li>in subsequent rounds, the first player is the second player from the previous round
 * <li>a round is
 * <ul>
 * <li>each player selects one card from their hand and in turn places it face down on the table
 * <li>once all players have played a card, the played cards are turned face up
 * <li>if there is a single highest card, whichever player played it takes all the cards and saves
 * them as a meld
 * <li>if two or more players played the highest card, there is no winner for that round and the
 * cards are placed face down on the discard pile
 * </ul>
 * <li>
 * <li>a player wins the round when their card is the highest played in that round
 * <li>if there is no winner in a round (2 or more players have the highest card), the cards are
 * discarded
 * <li>the cards won during a round are given to the player with the highest card and saved as a
 * meld
 * <li>the game ends when the specified number of rounds have been played
 * <li>whichever player has the most melds at the end of the game wins
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * NOTE You must rename this class to whatever your game is called. If the name of the game begins
 * with a number, spell out the number (can't start a class name with a digit). Replace the comments
 * above describing my game with appropriate comments for yours.
